          <p class="main_text" id="march_text" >What begun in China, COVID-19 has made its way to Canada and has been announced as a global pandemic. To contain the virus as best they can, Canada forbid international travels and advised citizens to stay at home. Due to this, some citizens were unable to work and struggled to find sources of income, causing the economy to descend drastically.</p>

          <p>Thankfully, Canada landed a helping hand to those affected by the pandemic by offering stimulus packages such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CESB came later in May). Canada helped ensure that citizens remained financially stable. Graphic designers helped workplaces transition to the online platform, so they can continue working.</p>

A quarantine extension has been applied by our Prime Minister. It was being extended till the end of summer due to COVID cases being on the rise. Things only started to get worse, and seemed like nothing good was going to come from this situation.</p>

          <p>On the bright side, ever since quarantine began, carbon dioxide emissions decreased substantially due to low energy demands in numerous economic sectors. It may not be a lot, but we've struggled to combat global warming for a while. It's good to know that we were able to make an impact without even trying. Now, imagine if we were trying.</p>

            <p class="main_text" id="july_text" >In Canada, we had one of the least amounts of COVID cases, but from July to September, cases have risen. Provinces across Canada such as Ontario, Quebec and Alberta have gone through a large increase in cases. The reports stayed elevated throughout the months, which led Justin Trudeau to declare that Canada is experiencing its second wave of COVID-19.</p>

Behind the scenes, technology has been achieving milestones during COVID. 5G will launch worldwide in 2020, which makes way to a brighter future for Canada perhaps.</p>

            <p>Despite the year 2020 being unpleasant till the end, there was still some good that came out of it. There were a lot more events that happened that I didn't cover, but the sad truth is, they couldn't all be good. The point was to see the silver lining in events that seemed like nothing good could've come from it. 2020 has been a real eye-opener, and as much as I didn't want the year to turn out this way, I believe it needed to, so let's jump into 2021 with utmost optimism!</p>
