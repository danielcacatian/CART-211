  <h3>WEEK 2 READING</h3>
  <p>“The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up” by Daniel Joseph</p>
  <p>“From Counterculture to Cyberculture” by Fred Turner</p>
  <p>I was fascinated by the fact that, in the years of 1960s-1970s, scientists had grand plans for the future. Just after the “Memex” they planned on going even further to the point where the first digital computer was invented. They had big
    aspirations for technological advancements , but around this time, advanced technology was exclusive to only scientists and researchers at prestigious universities. Although, if it weren’t for the devices being in the hands of scientists and
    researchers, we wouldn’t have won World War II. I’m sure of this fact because I watched “The Imitation Game” where a computer was utilized to aid the war when the British had their backs up against the wall. Good movie by the way. When you think
    about it, computer technology had a huge impact during those years, and it was brand new. Nowadays, computers or technological advancements, in general, is greater than ever and has a major influence in everyone’s lives. We’re taking online
    classes now, while back then, computers were for research purposes for scientists and the military. Jobs that were artistically done by hand are not done in computers like graphic design. Look how far we’ve come, and we’re still making
    breakthroughs when it comes to technology.</p>
  <p>I do wonder how things would’ve ended up if Canada did have its own Internet. Although the USA did not entirely mess up, Canada had good reason to fear the consequences of the USA being the center of the Internet and having Canada be reliant on
    them. With every second on the internet, we are being monitored, people do have access to our personal information like Facebook, and we could potentially be spied on. However, I’m satisfied with the results on how the Internet came to be because
    if the US failed, perhaps Canada would’ve as well. Maybe if Canada did have their own Internet, things would’ve been better. Our presence on the Internet would have been more private and it wouldn’t be controlled by the government. Who knows, but
    all I know is that things could’ve been worse.</p>
